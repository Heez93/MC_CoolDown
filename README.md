# MC_CoolDown a World of Warcraft Addon

MAINLY LUA BASED!

This addon should display an important skill's icon while it is on cooldown.
When the specific skill(s) is/are off cooldown, the icon should fade away or simply disappear.


The project is in its early development. I just started coding with LUA. 
Any suggestions appreciated.
